				Intro: {
					0: Hello, traveller.
					1: It's been a long time since I've seen a new face.
					2: Call me the Apotheosis.
					3: Find us at the center of our verdant plants,
					4: and we might have some gifts to help you along.
					5: Farewell, for now.
				}

				Greeting: {
					0: Remember to breathe,
					1: keep the plants thriving,
					2: and return to me once you've slain the great eye.
					3: May we find each other in good spirits soon.
				}

				Idle: {
					Normal: {
						0: I'm particularly proud of those bouncy sprouts.
						1: We seek to harbor arbour; has it worked?
						2: Where's my quill - hm?
						3: '''"I", "we"; it's all the same.'''
						4: I've nothing more to add.
						5: Go out and smell the flowers.
						6: Run along, now.
						7: Have you seen a snake around here?
						8: I remember the smell of the flowers, still.
						9: Snails are underappreciated creatures.
						10: The world is your garden, my friend.
						11: No need to dawdle.
					}

					EvilBoss: {
						0: May grace befall you.
						1: The {0} is no more.
						2: A presence lifted from the infestation...
					}

					Thoughts: {
						0: ...where nature is most plain and pure...
						1: Hmm...what to do...
						2: ...pest control...
						3: Ah, memories...
						4: Research, research, research...
					}

					EoC: That great eye was a wonder, if a threat.

					Skeletron: {
						0: That skeleton was...a confusing one.
						1: The poor man's freedom is obtained...
					}

					MiscBosses: {
						KingSlime: Ah, the King of Slimes has been slain, wonderful...
						QueenBee: Hopefully you're having a nice time with our bees.
						Scarabeus: The desert sands feel calmer now.
						MJW: Ah, I remember those glowing jellyfish nights...
						VinewrathBane: The flowers feel more relaxed now. Thank you.
						AncientAvian: The skies are more at peace now, well done.
						StarplateRaider: We were curious about that glowing mech, but alas...
					}
				}

				Downed: {
					EoC: {
						0: The eye is felled. Thank you.
						1: Take this trinket. Return to me once you've beaten the {0}.
					}

					Evil: {
						0: Our gratitude for defeating the {0}...
						1: Our penultimate request; fell the great skeleton near the dungeon.
						2: Here's some of my old gear...with some changes.
					}

					Skeletron: {
						0: The dungeon's souls are...partially freed.
						1: You're deserving - take these. Our favourites.
					}

					WoF: {
						0: A powerful spirit has been released...
						1: With us...more free, you'll begin to see a couple changes.
						2: You might've already noticed a couple. Anyhow,
						3: as thanks, take this. I...don't need it anymore.
					}

					AnyMech: {
						0: One of those machines are vanquished.
						1: Well done! I've been making something...
						2: It's...odd, but fun. We hope you enjoy it.
					}

					Plantera: {
						0: The horrific plant is dead.
						1: This frees up many opportunities;
						2: this is a smaller boon, but we hope it helps.
						3: You may now create more of these yourself as well.
					}
				}

				PestControlNotif: {
					0: With the wall defeated,
					1: we are free to purify.
					2: You've certainly noticed the corruption of this world, hm?
					3: There's...an agreement we can come to.
					4: This corruption is a ghost over a body;
					5: and we can help purify the body and push back the ghost.
					6: Simply give us, ah, this...effigy.
					7: Be prepared, be well, and I send you luck.
				}

				PestControlWarning: {
					0: Are you sure you wish to start?
					1: This is no simple matter.
					2: Leave if you need to prepare;
					3: we shall be here.
				}

				PestControl: {
					0: Very well.
					1: You best have prepared.
					2: Pests must be controlled, invasion quelled,
					3: and you must defeat them. Good luck.
