		"Supposedly from a distant island, unknown.
		Would make for an incredible research opportunity!
		Striations of obsidian line the rock, 
		along with ember particles throughout? Research later.
		Various hints of iron, bismite, lead
		and obsidian in no particular order.
		Despite its age, still warm to the touch - also sounds hollow?
		Need more samples, asked around...no replies.
		Might go searching for more.
		It's been a while!
		Map shows a volcanic area around [scratch mark] or so..."
					
		Despite the introduction, this book seems to slowly
		change in purpose - becoming sort of an explorer's log:
					
		"Adventure going well,
		though fruitless; idyll forests
		sit patiently, as
					
		what awaits me at
		the end of this adventure -
		a great volcano...
					
		I'm just sure of it."

			"Full of water? sugar?
			Tastes bland, a bit sweet, bit of dirt, mildly grassy, and
			a tinge of iron (or other metal? Test later.)
			Rare, don't have too much to test on.
			Go searching for more later, might be good food.
			Beyond analysis, these are incredible specimens...
			Will make for better light than these fireflies"
						
			Random things line pages: scribbles, sketches, notes.
			Occasionally there's a small tidbit of salvageable info:
			"Grows better in dirty water?"
			"How would this work in sunlight?"
			"Almost flowers when growing." +
			"Soft, but hardy. Hm."

			The book looks particularly old, page worn and oddly brown.
			The material is also clearly foreign.
			There's drops of water across the top pages.
			There's also tons of minor scribbles.
			The scribbles seem first of random surface landscapes,
			then of random mundane cave objects...for some reason.
			There's no dates or authors mentioned, apart from a
			signature:

			"Almost fabric like texture, durable yet soft.
			Inexplicably calming to hold, grows well in bulb light.
			Unpleasant to eat, tastes like grass and dirt.
			Plentiful, might use (books? pages? look soon).
			Might work in small parts?
			Grows in vine like clumps, or just clumps? Unsure.
			Grow only or mostly around flowers.
						
			(DO NOT EAT)
						
			Tried pressing into pages, seem to work but needs
			more work. Pages are too green."

		"The final shreds of life around here
		Incredibly durable, despite how thin they are.
		Trying to cut one of these apart is borderline futile.
		They grow sparsely, surrounded by more average, smaller
		vines, leaves and flora.
		Sometimes flower, with small light bulbs on them.
					
		DO NOT EAT
					
		Like lettuce but leathery and dirtier.
		Can be used to create incredibly sturdy ropes.
		Look into use as a reinforcement?
		...I don't know if I can."
					
		The few remaining pages have small sketches and
		the occasional small note -
					
		"...more plentiful now?..."
		"New specimens are getting stockier"
		"...sprouting more often..."
					
		- until the book ends.

		"It's been a while since I've run out of supplies.
		My caravan is empty aside from research,
		with mice and bats being all I can eat.
		Water is surprisingly clean and fresh
		around here, so...it’s just hunger.
		Some research is done, however.
		I'm categorizing the flora around here, and it's...magical.
		To a point where I’m not sure that's simply a term,
		or just the truth.
		Some surprisingly lush grass and foliage around,
		I've even seen some minor tree saplings here and there.
		A most curious wood, too!
		Despite my starvation, this is a heaven I’ll suffer for."
				

		...


		"The meager morsels of this land have been sufficient for some
		time, though barely.
		I've set up a small but acceptable study,
		both to hold my things and to keep myself safe.
		Often an errant skeleton or angry bat finds itself around me,
		and I am an explorer; monster slayer naught.
		That being said, food grows scarcer yet.
		Beyond bats, I’ve lost mice - seems the little critters have
		learned their biggest threat.
		Time lies outside of my reach.
		Studies notwithstanding, I’ve little left anyhow."

				
		...


		"Time grows weary; as do I.
		Studies continue, fervor reaching new heights
		as I see things unique to this strange cavern.
		Behind the hunger pains, the fatigue;
		despite my dismal state of being,
		I live stronger than I've ever lived.
		To me, this is life, the creatures around here
		thrive, play, talk, and fight.
		Perhaps there's even more I can't see.
		Alas, Death comes knocking, and I've no way to close the door.
		But perhaps, in some other time,
		these plants find another pair of eyes,
		and bewilder as I have been bewildered."
				
				
		...
				
				
		"View; a flower. A flower with a bulb in it, a curious one -
		betwixt the petals, a gentle glow.
		A calming glow.
		A glow unlike anything I’ve seen in my time here.
		I’ve all but abandoned my study.
		There’s no food, and I’m on my last breaths.
		My only regret is being unable to study this flora,
		this gift presented before me.
		...
		May someone find my work.
		May some passion revive what I’ve died doing.
		May this journal find someone in good health,
		in good spirits,
		and goodbye."
