	Intro: {
		0: Hello, traveller.
		1: It's been a long time since I've seen a new face.
		2: Call me the Apotheosis.
		3: Find us at the center of our verdant plants,
		4: and we might have some gifts to help you along.
		5: Farewell         .
	}

	# Intro.5 "Farewell" line has a little extra space to fade out nicely, keep it there.
	# Try to keep the following lines around the same length, if possible
	
	Greeting: {
		0: Remember to breathe,
		1: keep the plants thriving,
		2: and return to me once you've slain the great eye.
		3: May we find each other in good spirits soon.
	}

	Idle: {
		Normal: {
			0: I'm particularly proud of those bouncy sprouts.
			1: We seek to harbor arbour; has it worked?
			2: Where's my quill - hm?
			3: '''"I", "we"; it's all the same.'''
			4: I've nothing more to add.
			5: Go out and smell the flowers.
			6: Run along, now.
			7: Have you seen a snake around here?
			8: I remember the smell of the flowers, still.
			9: Snails are underappreciated creatures.
			10: The world is your garden, my friend.
			11: No need to dawdle.
		}

		EvilBoss: {
			0: May grace befall you.
			1: The {0} is no more.
			2: A presence lifted from the infestation...
		}

		Thoughts: {
			0: ...where nature is most plain and pure...
			1: Hmm...what to do...
			2: ...pest control...
			3: Ah, memories...
			4: Research, research, research...
		}

		EoC: That great eye was a wonder, if a threat.

		Skeletron: {
			0: That skeleton was...a confusing one.
			1: The poor man's freedom is obtained...
		}

		MiscBosses: {
			KingSlime: Ah, the King of Slimes has been slain, wonderful...
			QueenBee: Hopefully you're having a nice time with our bees.
			Scarabeus: The desert sands feel calmer now.

			VinewrathBane: The flowers feel more relaxed now. Thank you.
			AncientAvian: The skies are more at peace now, well done.
			StarplateRaider: We were curious about that glowing mech, but alas...
		}

	Downed: {
		EoC: {
			0: The eye is felled. Thank you.
			1: Take this trinket. Return to me once you've beaten the {0}.
		}

		Evil: {
			0: Our gratitude for defeating the {0}...
			1: Our penultimate request; fell the great skeleton near the dungeon.
			2: Here's some of my old gear...with some changes.
		}

		Skeletron: {
			0: The dungeon's souls are...partially freed.
			1: You're deserving - take these. Our favourites.
		}

		WoF: {
			0: A powerful spirit has been released...
			1: With us...more free, you'll begin to see a couple changes.
			2: You might've already noticed a couple. Anyhow,
			3: as thanks, take this. I...I don't need it anymore.
		}

		AnyMech: {
			0: One of those machines are vanquished.
			1: Well done! I've been making something...
			2: It's...odd, but fun. We hope you enjoy it.
		}

		Plantera: {
			0: The horrific plant is dead.
			1: This frees up many opportunities;
			2: this is a smaller boon, but we hope it helps.
			3: You may now create more these yourself as well.
			4: Feel free to take these as well,
			5: With these, we are certain they'll help.
		}

		Golem: {
			0: The Temple's protector felled.
			1: This is a bit of a...passion project, of mine.
			2: We don't know if it'll help much,
			3: but we suspect it'll be fun.
			4: Best of luck.
		}

		Cultist: {
			0: Those charlatans dead, hm?
			1: Their practice was a dangerous idiocy.
			2: Less and less threats are...up close, I see.
			3: Perhaps we can offer a sliver of our power,
			4: to your boon. Enjoy.
		}

		MoonLord: {
			0: I suspect that's the final fight.
			1: We don't know what else you have planned;
			2: and we have little more to give.
			3: It's been a lot of fun,
			4: a lot of work,
			5: and I think we need a break.
			6: Perhaps you'll see something new in the future.

	PestControlNotif: {
		0: With the wall defeated,
		1: we are free to purify.
		2: You've certainly noticed the corruption of this world, hm?
		3: There's...an agreement we can come to.
		4: This corruption is a ghost over a body;
		5: and we can help purify the body and push back the ghost.
		6: Simply give us, ah, this...effigy.
		7: Be prepared, be well, and I send you luck.
	}

	PestControlWarning: {
		0: Are you sure you wish to start?

		2: Leave if you need to prepare;
		3: we shall be here.
	}

	PestControl: {
		0: Very well.
		1: You best have prepared.
		2: Pests must be controlled, invasion quelled,
		3: and you must defeat them. Good luck.

			0: My old notebook.
			1: I remember writing in it all the time,
			2: I still get the itch to, here and there.
			3: Oh well, we can't use it anymore.
			4: It's bizarre enough to regard it at all,

		}

		Bouncebloom: {
			0: We were...still figuring things out.
			1: Fun, though.
		}
