----The Verdant Mod----
-- 1.4.4 Update --
by GabeHasWon

This mod adds the Verdant, a fairly small, underground biome that spawns naturally, containing many types of plants and critters.
It has the following basic content:
    - 235 new items
    - 158 new tiles
    - 4 new armor sets
    - Absolutely no new town NPCs
    - 18 new NPCs (mostly critters)
    - 4 brand new music tracks
    - A new foreground and background system that gives more life to the biome
    - A sort of quest system by the statue in the center of the biome, the Apotheosis
    - Way too much decoration

----Frequently Asked Questions----
Q: Does this mod work with Calamity?
A: It should work. For that matter, it should work with any mod!
