----The Verdant Mod----
-- Hardmode Update --
by GabeHasWon

This mod adds the Verdant, a fairly small, underground biome that spawns naturally, containing many types of plants and critters.
It has the following basic content:
    - 181 new items
    - 137 new tiles
    - 14 new walls
    - 16 new NPCs
    - 4 brand new music tracks
    - A new foreground and background system that gives more life to the biome
    - A sort of quest system by the statue in the center of the biome, the Apotheosis
    - A ton of small touches and mechanics to give life to the game
    - Way too much decoration

----Frequently Asked Questions----
Q: Does this mod work with Calamity?
A: It should work. For that matter, it should work with any mod!

Q: Do I need to make a new world for the Hardmode update?
A: If you're in hardmode, you will miss the new Mysteria microbiome. If you're not in hardmode, you will miss only one or two items.

If you'd be so generous, joining the Patreon would help me out a ton. 
As a hobbyist developer, I spend most of my free time making stuff like this mod.
If any of you could chip in, I'd appreciate it greatly! I'd also be able to speed up development on all of my projects.
